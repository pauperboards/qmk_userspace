# Userspace Code

My user-space keymap is defined here, in [layers.h](layers.h), with the conversion macros defined in [wrappers.h](wrappers.h). Combos are, of course, defined in [combos.h](combos.h) and [combos.c](combos.c), respecively.

This is all fairly standard QMK user configuration, and is referenced by files in the `keyboards` directory at the top level.
